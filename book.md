chapter 1
=========

It all began with water.  I was 15, and football was the most important
thing that was happening in my life. Wake up, go to school, exercise.
When summer came around, I had to find a job.  My wonderful mother
talked to some people  and found me a job (she's remarkably good at that)
working on a sprinkler truck.  I could always count on her to know
someone, somewhere that could help me get an in.  She was friends with
Berry fey for crying out loud.  "You want tickets to the concert?",
people would say, "well let me talk to my mom."

Getting in the swing of outdoor work was hard.  I never wanted to wake
up at the crack of dawn.  I still dont want to now.  I would put
togeather some semblance of a lunch, mostly things that were in the
fridge, and wait for vince to show up.

Vince
-----

Vince was a standup guy.  The name of the company was Sprinkler Masters,
and I think that it was accurate.  Vince knew everything there was to
know about outdoor irrigation.  I was always amazed at how whatever
problem came up, he had some sort of trick to get it fixed. There was
never a time where he threw up his hands and said, "I don't know,"
because he always did. There was a subtle grace in his handling of
problems.  Never a raise in tone, never anger. Vince just knew what had
to get done.  He was the kind of guy you wanted as a boss.  That kind of
confidince if hard to come by, especially from someone who had made
their way into a leadership role.

Vince had worked long hours in a grocery store before he started doing 
sprinkler work. He worked his ass off so that he could start his own
business.  That dedication was amazing.  I think that's what it takes to
really strike it out on your own.  You have to be extremely passionate
and dedicated about what it is your doing.  Without those 2 things, your
destined to fail. 

His attire was impeccable.  He would wear a button-down shirt, tan slacks and 
suspenders. And to top it all off, he was always wearing a safari hat. Among
 people in the business, he was somewhat of an anomaly. You call a 
sprinkler guy, and expect a grubby dude in jeans and a t-shirt.  Instead 
you get this guy who shows up looking like he's going to lead you on a 
safari.  I think that was part of his edge.  He was really good at getting 
high profile clients. People in nice places wanted a
guy like vince walking around the grounds.  If you look out your window
and see someone dressed better than you working in your yard, on his
hands and knees with a shovel, you have to
respect that. He knew that too. On more than one occasion, he would
allude that his attire was how we got the job.  

One of the most important skills I have ever learned I picked up on the
job with vince. How to dig.  It seems so basic, but it's so easy to get
wrong. There's alot of technique that goes into every upstroke, every
plunge of the shovel.  Using your legs is incredibly crucial.  Once you
start to lift with your back, your in trouble. Digging is legs and arms.  
The more you put into the downstroke, the more earth you can move. The
faster you move earth, the quicker you get to the line. The faster you
get to the sprinkler line, the faster you make the repair, and the
faster you get to the next job.  Sounds obvious, right?  Try telling
that to a slackass on your crew that's moving at a snails pace and
thinks that this makes the time pass faster.  All he's doing is holding
everything up, and seriously, we need to make money, right?  This is the
guy that for every 2 shovels of dirt you move, this guy is struggling
around with his shovel pretending to get it in the ground.  Nobody hits
that many roots man, get with the program!  The industry is full of
these people.  I had days where I was one of them, but were just talking
days.  I didn't make a career out of complaining about every time I had
to pick up a shovel. Those are the guys that always seemed to get hurt.
You can tell when your stuck with one of these jimopes.  Complain the
whole way to the site.  Every 5 minutes this guys sitting in the shade
sucking on his water.  Has anyone even seen him do anything yet?  No.
Alot of this attitude, I believe, stems from people not knowing how to
dig.  It's tough work.  You sweat, and you get tired.  But that's what
makes it fun.  A wise man who we called Pops (more on him later) once stated, "why join a
gym, were gardeners." If you finish your day and your not dog tired and
ready to relax, your doing it wrong. This work takes it out of you.  And
you learn to respect that.  At the end of the day, you really feel like
you accomplished something.  And to actually get anything done, you have
to dig some holes. Bad form can shorten a career. Back problems are very
common across the industry, and learning incorrect habits early can
really shorten a career.  I thank Vince for teaching me to do it the
right way. 
  Vince dug like a madman. He had a crazy look in his eye, like he was
going to kill the ground with his shovel.  He would tell me "I was up
last night sharpening the shovels," and throw a crazy stare at the tip
of the blade before he buried it in the earth, ripping it out, and
stabbing it back in again. Sometimes he almost looked out of control,
like someone who was in a hurry to bury a dead body.
You definitely wanted to give him plenty of space when he was weilding
the shovel, he could easily take  you out or bury the blad six inches in
your shoulder.  Often there was no option other than to work close to
him. You just had to be on your guard.  When he was hitting soft earth
and it was early in the morning, he would let out a loud cackle when he
was digging, like a crazy man with no concept of others around him. His
facination with country music protected the clients from ever hearing
this, but if you were working close, you would catch it, look up and see
that mad twinkle in his eyes.  He loved what he was doing. 
  We did alot more digging than other sprinkler crews, especially on installs.  
Other teams would come in with a "ditch witch," a
device that would rip up a foot wide path of earth at least 6 inches
deep and throw it out to the side.  This tool had no disregard for what
the sod looked like when it was done.  And when "witch wimps," as we called them, 
were done, the yard always
looked like shit. Sure they would put donw grass seed, and by mid season it
kind of started to look like the lawn was coming back up.  But it still
looked like ass for at least most of the first season after the system
had been installed. 
  We had a different technique.  For short lines, we
would cut out the sod by hand, making strait lines facing eachother in
four foot lengths, then rolling the sod out and clearing out the ditch
to about eight inches deep. This would let us roll the sod right back
into place, tamp it down after the line was in, and after a few waters
back to normal.  For longer lines, Vince would break out the tractor.
He pulled this thing behind his truck to jobs where we were doing an
install.  It was basically a riding lawnmower with a backhoe on the
rear.  What he did with the backhoe was ingenious though.  He fashioned
a 'blade' of sorts that utilized the up down movement of the backhoe.
The sharp side faced the tractor. On
the end of the blade was a 'bullet.' The bullet was about 2 inches in
diameter, pointed at one end, and had a chain hanging off the back. We
could attach different connectors to the chain, then attach sprinkler
line to the connector.  The knife would cut about 6-8 inches into the
ground.  We could do what the wich wimps did without throwing dirt and
sod everywhere and leaving things looking like shit.  It was a sight to
behold.  There were some drawbacks though.  No unsightliness like the
ditch witch, but we had to do a good bit more digging because of our
'leave no trace,' approach.  everywhere there was a big turn, one that
could potentially kink the line, we would have to dig a spot for an
angle coupling. If the line was going to T out or split into a 4 way, we
would dig that out. Wherever there was going to be a sprinkler head, we
another hole had to be dug. This seems to be how all well respected
craftsmen operate.  They have superior techniques, and the result of
those techniques yeild a superior product.  The also tend to put more
effort into their product though.  We were irrigation craftsmen.  Our
systems were immaculate.  A week after we were done, you wouldn't even know
we were there. We took pride in what we did, and it showed. 
  Vince knew how to do the math so we got complete coverage. In order to
do this properly, we would take a psi reading from the mainline.  From
this reading, vince would map out the location of all the heads and
valve boxes.  The drawings he produced were top notch.  He would use
these to come up with estimates.  He always seemed spot on with his
guesses.
  Speaking of mainlines, I think I should mention one of the dreads of
the irrigation technician.  Installing a stop & waste.  This can be an
easy task if it can be installed off a main line close to the building,
or it can go the other way.  The other was to basically dig a
grave.  You have to get down and find the main water line, which can be
6-8 feed below ground. You never know exacly where it's going to be
either, so your hole has to be fairly large.  One learns to dread the
soil makeup of colorado after digging a few stop and waste valves.  On
dry days, it gets to be pretty hard, pretty fast.  If it's raining, it's
like moving cement.  Either way, vince never brought in a backhoe for
these jobs.  We would dig out the ditches by hand. This would typically
be a large part of a day, digging out a stop and waste.  One man in the
hole.  And being as I was the least competent of the crew of three, I
was usually the one in the ditch.  Vince would hover over the hole
periodically let out one of his cackles and ask something like "find
anything yet?", I would usually just let out a grunt, or swear under my
breath.
  Being an irrigation technician is a multidiciplinary profession.  You
have to have a basic understand of hydrology in order to properly place
heads and account for changes in pressure over the landscape.  There is
also a decent bit of horticulture involved, centering around what type
of water plants need, and how they prefer to get it.  Some plants really
struggle when they get alot of water on the leaves. It can cause
disease, and in some cases cause flower buds to abort. Sprinkler guys
also need to be electricians.  We would have to wire up valve boxes,
trace broken electric lines and set up timer clocks.  If something goes
wrong, you can fry one of your most expensive parts, or get really hurt
if your not careful.  There was also an expected metal working
competency.  We would have to be able to sweat copper in aqward
positions frequently, sometimes in the darkness of a crawlspace with a
flashlight.  Get your hand in the flame or spill hot solder on yourself,
and your in for a bad day.

Vince was certainly an interesting character. He was extremely bad at
getting from one place to another, to the point that it was comical. I
should say that my own sense of direction is also extremely poor, and if
I think his way bad, that's really saying something.
Every day he would pick me up, and get lost on his way out of the
neighborhood. It was like this every day for the 2 summers I worked for
him.  Then every day when he would drop me off, it was the same thing.
"Is this where I need to get off the highway?" he would ask. "Same place
as yesterday vince." He would snarkly reply, "I knew that." The truck he drove was an
old converted package carrier.  This was ideally suited to our type of
work, because we could keep a well stocked supply of parts on hand at
all times.  Everything was kept organized in bins and it was very
convenient to find what you needed quickly. Very organized Vince was.
Maybe even a little too organized.
He always kept a plastic milk jug and a 5 gallon bucket on 
the truck.  You see, one of the other advantages of having such a large
closed in compartment was that it could double as a bathroom.  Vince
never used a client's bathroom.  He pissed in the milk jug and shit in
the bucket. He took all of his waste home with him and buried it. The
reasoning he told me was that his customers didn't want him in their
homes or businesses.  So in order to ease his interactions with them, he
brought his own bathroom along. I always secretly thought he was trying to build up
fertility at his home. The logic made sense, and 
I'm sure this was fine for one man, but it always felt a
bit strange to share these things with him.  I mean I stuck my dick in the
same hole as my boss.  Saying that out of context just sounds wrong. Not
something I put on a resume to say the least.
